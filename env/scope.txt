Start by making it work through command line
DB set up
Person - relates to the human using the service

1. When first open need to check if person is logged in (is there a user in users table)
    If there isn't then need to request person to create an account
        Request to create username - can't already exist in DB users table
        Request to create password - enter twice to ensure they match - must be X len
    If there is one or more users in the users table - person needs to log in - request username and password
        If password is incorect give a second chance
        If second chance password is incorect quit application
        When correct move onto 2.
    
2. Once logged in present options list and ask person for input to which option they want to select
    a. Option to get a password 
        get password on app name
            return password and copy to clip board
        get password on app URL
            return password and copy to clip board
    b. Option to generate a new password
        ask for app name
            if it already exists ask if person wants to update the current password
                auto generate new password and update passwords row and print to user
            if it doesn't exist save as variable
                check if person wants to add an app URL
                    if yes
                        request for app URL then save to variable
                    if no skip
                    check if there are any requirements for the password
                        length
                        letters
                        numbers
                        special characthers
                    generate password based on requirements
                    save password and info to passwords table, auto generate remaining information required
                    print app name and password to user
    c. View all passwords
        return a list of all the persons passwords to them
        order by created date
        display one row per line in print out
        print app name, password, created date
 

----------------------------------Future Scope----------------------------------
- Hashing of passwords before storing
- Before deleting password need to re-enter user password
- Before viewing all passwords need to re-enter user password
- Stop SQL injection attacks - figure out how to test an SQL injection attack
- Saving to GitHub for others to use and develop upon
- Store the user details so the same computer can stay logged in when restaarting the application 
- Check age of passwords and advise they are changed every x time period
- Graphical Interface - python based extension
- Develop into proper application - can be downloaded and installed etc...
- Store database in the cloud so passwords can be accessed from any device
- Browser plug in to auto offer when accessing website
