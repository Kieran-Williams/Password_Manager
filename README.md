Built in Python - Currently can only be used through command line

Future Scope:

- Hashing of passwords before storing
- Before deleting password need to re-enter user password
- Before viewing all passwords need to re-enter user password
- Stop SQL injection attacks - figure out how to test an SQL injection attack
- Saving to GitHub for others to use and develop upon
- Store the user details so the same computer can stay logged in when restaarting the application
- Check age of passwords and advise they are changed every x time period
